# System Overview

This document proposes an application that allows young children to get learning out of videos that they watch on a daily basis. The application offers a selection of activities that consist of a YouTube video and quiz questions about the video, all prompted throughout the its duration. Users answer the questions using their voice. There are settings to let users decide whether the video continues or rewinds when a question is answered incorrectly. The application records and tracks users' individual progress, saving data such as watchtime, correctly and incorrectly answered  questions, and video data.

# Conceptual Design

# Background

[EdPuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/) is a similar application. It also incorporates YouTube videos to promote learning. The website gives options to create video quizzes with multiple choice answers and even voice-recorded responses. The videos are linked and questions are added by teachers, with features to grade student responses and connect to LMS. However, Piggyback Learning focuses on encouraging children to pay attention to everyday videos, not just educational content. Responses and grading are also done through voice detection in real time.
