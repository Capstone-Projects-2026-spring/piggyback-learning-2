# Features and Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Users must be able to create their own accounts (username, password, accountID)
- Users must have different permission levels that will give them access to which videos they can watch. Think parental controls: the parent’s account can control what the kids account can / cannot watch.
- If the user answers a quiz question(s) wrong, there should be fall back options (multiple choice?)
- User data should be saved and logged in the database (user id, video id, watch time, correct / incorrect answer)
- There should be a dashboard that contains:
	- Summary
	- Users
	- Settings

## Nonfunctional Requirements

- Improvements to voice recognition:
	- Voice recognition needs to be able to interpret less ‘perfectly worded’ input (ie the screaming of a child, different accents, etc)
	- Should be able to map input to answers, even if they are not the same 
- Response time needs to be improved on
